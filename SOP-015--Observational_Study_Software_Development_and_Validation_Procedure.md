## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes requirements for developing
custom software used to collect, process, or analyze subject data in
*observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitute__. It implements QM-001
Section 7.9.

This procedure ensures that:

- Software requirements are specified and documented
- Software design and architecture are documented
- Development practices maintain code quality and traceability
- Testing is proportionate to risk
- Software releases are controlled and documented
- Defects are tracked and resolved
- Software is maintained throughout its lifecycle

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to custom software developed by __NewInstitute__ for use
in *observational studies*, including:

- Software used to collect subject data (e.g., mobile applications, web-based
  applications, wearable device interfaces)
- Software used to process, transform, or analyze subject data

This procedure covers software development practices from requirements
specification through maintenance and retirement.

This procedure does **NOT** apply to:

- Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software, which is managed under
  [SOP-004: Computer System Validation, Data Integrity and Data Management
  Procedure](SOP-004--Computer_System_Validation_Data_Integrity_and_Data_Management_Procedure.md)
- Configuration of commercial software platforms (e.g., REDCap, EDC systems),
  which is managed under SOP-004
- Software developed by external vendors, which is managed under
  [SOP-006: Outsourced Activities
  Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md) with validation per
  SOP-004

Software validation, including risk-based validation methodology and formal
validation documentation, is managed under SOP-004. This procedure establishes
development practices that support validation activities.

Software-related documents are controlled under
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls
Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md) and maintained
in the TMF.

Changes to validated software are managed under the validated system and
software change control process in SOP-004 Section 4.8.1.

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitute__ employees and subcontractors
involved in:

- Software requirements specification
- Software design and development
- Software testing
- Software release and deployment
- Software maintenance
